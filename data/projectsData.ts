I wanted to create a place where we could meet and talk to people, share pictures from your trip and precise where you took it on a map, book hostels and plane tickets and save all those data in the same place in the user's phone, share your trip and all kinds of tips like that an algo could have offer great trip to the futur users based on the data provided by the users. And even warns you about hard to cross borders and provides you all the links to your ambassy to get you visa. But this app will probably never possess all those functionalities. I implemented a signing in form made of three steps. The first one is for the authentification data, the second one for his personal data like the user's name and the third one is for the extra data (all the data that will be public). Every user can create a post containing a text and or a picture. After creating it he can delete it or edit it if he wants. An admin possess the same rights to insure that the app remains a secure area for all the users. All the posts can be filtered by country. A like and dislike logic has been implemented on the posts. Every user has his own profile page where he can add some more extra data, like new trips he made or create a new album containing all the pictures he made during his trip. Each user can follow or unfollow the other users.",
