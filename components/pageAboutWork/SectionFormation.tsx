                        &quot;I started learning web development during November
                        2021.
                        <br />
                        At first I only took a look at this field because I knew
                        it would allow me to travel and work at the same time.
                        <br />
                        But eventually I discovered myself a new passion where
                        creativity and logic were the only limits
                        <br />
                        After 6 months learning programming languages on my own
                        from youtube chanels like FromScratch and openClassrooms
                        free lessons. I decided to quit my job and pursue formal
                        education
                        <br />I chose <strong>OpenClassrooms</strong> because
                        that&apos;s where it all began for me.
                        <br />I received my diploma four months later but I did
                        not start looking for a job right away. I wanted to
                        build a project from scratch and create a portfolio to
                        showcase my work.&quot;

            </div>
        </section>
    );
};

export default SectionFormation;
