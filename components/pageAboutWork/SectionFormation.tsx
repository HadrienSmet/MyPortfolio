                        &quot;I started learning web development during November
                        2021.

                        At first I only took a look at this field because I knew
                        it would allow me to travel and work at the same time.

                        But eventually I discovered myself a new passion where
                        creativity and logic were the only limits
                        <br />

                        After 6 months learning programming languages on my own
                        from youtube chanels like FromScratch and Web Dev
                        Simplified or even from openClassrooms free lessons. I
                        decided to quit my job and pursue formal education

                    <em>
                        I chose <strong>OpenClassrooms</strong> because
                        that&apos;s where it all began for me.

                        I received my diploma four months later but I did not
                        start looking for a job right away. I wanted to build a
                        project from scratch and create a portfolio to showcase
                        my work.&quot;
