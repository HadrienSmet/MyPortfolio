                        &quot;I started learning web development during November
                        2021.
                        <br />
                        At first I only took a look at this world because I knew
                        it would have allowed me to travel across the world and,
                        at the same time, being able to work.
                        <br />
                        But in the end I discovered myself a new passion where
                        creativity and logic were the only limits
                        <br />
                        After 6 months learning programming languages on my own
                        from youtube chanels like FromScratch and openClassrooms
                        free lessons. I decided to quit my job and start a real
                        formation
                        <br />I chose <strong>OpenClassrooms</strong> because it
                        was the place where everything started for me.
                        <br />I got my diploma four months later but I did not
                        start to look for a job right away. I wanted to build a
                        project on my own from scratch and I wanted to create a
                        portfolio to expose my work.&quot;
